**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in our domain is smart contracts, specifically deploying them within the context of a decentralized, anonymous marketplace. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
A future implementation to investigate would be to implement a similar marketplace but for betting. Within this new marketplace, a user can propose a bet, followed by a dollar amount to bet and odds for each side (how the odds are chosen is not yet thought out). Then, another user can see that bet and establish an agreement. This would circumvent the need for casinos, which tilt the odds heavily in their favor to the point that it is beyond unfair.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
A potential change to our approach would be to work more cohesively instead of on separate tasks alone. For the quarter 1 project, we each did our own separate task and then reconvened to try and piece together what we did. While this helps with peer-programming, this was inefficient at times as we did not have the same vision for what to accomplish and how to do this. Instead, we can establish more clear guidelines for what to do and then have more frequent check-ups such that the issue of not being on the same page will no longer happen.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in exploring a unique, non-sellable item (such as an NFT) to establish a rating system. For instance, this could build up a user's credibility or tell others to avoid a potential seller based on their history.
